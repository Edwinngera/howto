########################
# Sync
########################

Ranking mirrors

This command will rank your mirrors by speed and will filter the out of date mirrors.
pacman-mirrors -g

You should sync the database after running this command by using: pacman -Syy

Optimize the database access speed
For full benefit, run this command after syncing the database.
pacman-optimize && sync

Attention: This command defragments Pacman's database, which boosts performance on slow hard drives but is harmful on SSDs. So, do not use this command on SSDs!

Syncing and Updating

Sync the database
pacman -Sy

You can force sync the database using the following command. It means, the database will be synced even if it's up to date. This is useful when you changed something repository related and want to have the changes take effect.
pacman -Syy

Updating
Pacman can update your system with only one command:
pacman -Su

Although, it is usually better to sync your repo database first:
pacman -Syu

This command was recommend:
pacman -Syyu

Update & ignore a package
The following changes take place in pacman's configuration file: /etc/pacman.conf
IgnorePkg=package_name

Update & ignore a package group
IgnoreGroup=package_group

Examples:
IgnoreGroup=gnome
IgnoreGroup=kde

########################
# install Remove
########################

It is always best to have the repo databases synchronized & then all packages installed on your system up to date before you install any new packages.
pacman -Syyu

# install package
pacman -S virtualbox

# force install package
pacman -S --force virtualbox

# Install a downloaded or a local package
pacman -U /package_path/package_name.pkg.tar.xz

# Reinstall all packages
pacman -S $(pacman -Qqen)

# Remove a package
pacman -R package_name

# Remove a package with dependencies that are not being used by other packages
pacman -Rs package_name

# Remove a package with all dependencies. Attention: The -c flag can remove needed dependencies, too. Only for advanced users.
pacman -Rsc package_name

# Remove a package and its configuration files too:
pacman -Rn package_name

# Forcefully remove a dependency without removing any other package. Attention: Only for advanced users.
pacman -Rdd package_name

########################
# Cleaning the cache
########################

# Leaves packages in your cache only for those packages which are currently installed on your system. Attention: This eliminates the possibility to Using Downgrade.
pacman -Sc

Clean cache completely and remove all packages. Attention: This eliminates the possibility to Using Downgrade.
pacman -Scc

A safer way to remove old package cache files is to remove all packages except for the latest three package versions:
paccache -rvk3

Cleaning orphan packages from the system. Also read Orphan Package Removal for further information.
pacman -Rsn $(pacman -Qdtq)

########################
# SEARCH
########################

#Provides a description of searched for package & associated packages
pacman -Ss package_name

Provides a description of previously installed package
pacman -Qs package_name

Provides detailed summary of a package
pacman -Si package_name

Modified summary:
pacman -Qi package_name

Get a list of installed packages
pacman -Q

Find out which package owns a file
pacman -Qo /file_path

List all orphan packages with no dependencies
pacman -Qdt

List all installed packages from the AUR
pacman -Qem

View package dependencies. Use one of the following commands:
pactree package_name
pactree -c package_name
pactree -s -c package_name

########################
# AUR (Arch User Repository)
########################

Following is info on three popular options for using the AUR, for a detailed list of their commands please look at their man pages:

Yaourt

Yaourt comes pre-installed with Manjaro so you normally won't have to install it. If you have removed it, this is how you install it again:
pacman -S base-devel yaourt

To use Yaourt to upgrade both official repos & AUR (only if new PKGBUILD files are available) use the following command:
yaourt -Syua

To use Yaourt to download and rebuild the latest AUR packages from their source (regardless of PKGBUILD files):
yaourt -Syua --devel

You can use all Pacman commands mentioned on this Wiki page with Yaourt, too. One command is different:
Removing orphaned packages is easier and more intuitive with Yaourt:
yaourt -Qdt

Packer

Uses some of the same commands as pacman but differs in that it checks both the official repos & AUR.
yaourt -S packer

Having installed 'packer' then you can run:
packer -S package_name

This will upgrade from both official repos & AUR:
packer -Syu
