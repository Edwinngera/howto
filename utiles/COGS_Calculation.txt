What's included in cost of goods sold?
Cost of raw materials
Cost of items purchased for resale
Cost of parts used to construct a product.

How is cost of goods sold calculated?

Beginning inventory
Plus cost of purchases/materials for items sold during the year
Minus ending inventory
Equals cost of goods sold for the year.

LIFO, FIFO, and Average Cost
Batch 1: 100 shirts at $5 each = $500
Batch 2: 300 shirts at $5.20 each = $1,520
Batch 3: 200 shirts at $5.25 each = $1,050


FIFO stands for "first in-first out" and it costs goods on the assumption that the first goods bought are the first goods sold. So the first 500 shirts bought would be costed under FIFO at $2,545.
LIFO stands for "last in-first out" and it costs goods on the assumption that the last goods bought are the first goods sold. So the last 500 shirts bought would be costed under LIFO at $2,570.
Average cost looks at all shirts bought and figures average cost per shirt, which is $5.12. Multiply by 500 shirts sold for a total cost of $2,580.

Information needed to calculate cost of goods sold

1. Valuation method: Designate whether inventory is valued at cost, lower of cost or market, or other. If you use the cash accounting method, you must value inventory at cost. Check with your tax preparer if you have changed your method of determining quantities, costs, or valuations. You must include an explanation of any changes.
2. Beginning inventory: The total cost of all the products in your inventory at the beginning of the year. This should be the same as the inventory at the end of last year. If it's not the same, you must provide an explanation.
3. Cost of purchases: Next, get a total of all the products you purchased during the year and that you placed in inventory to sell. Subtract any products you took out for personal use. If you are a manufacturer, you'll need to include the total cost of all raw materials and parts purchased during the year. Don't worry about whether they are assembled or not.
4. Cost of labor: This is your business's cost for employees who work directly making a product from raw materials and parts. It doesn't include costs for administrators or employees in sales, marketing, finance, or other areas.
5. Cost of materials and supplies: These costs must be directly related to making the product.
6. Other costs, including shipping containers, freight in on materials and supplies, and overhead expenses for rent, light, heat, etc. for the area where the products are being manufactured or assembled.
7. Ending inventory.Determine the total value of all items in inventory at the end of the year.

Cost of Goods Sold - COGS

There are one of three methods that a company must use when recording the level of inventory sold during a period – First In, First Out (FIFO), Last In, First Out (LIFO), and Average Cost Method.

Cost of goods sold is calculated in one of two ways. One way is to adjust the cost of the goods purchased or manufactured by the change in inventory of finished goods. For example, if 1,000 units were purchased or manufactured but inventory increased by 100 units then the cost of 900 units will be the cost of goods sold. If 1,000 units were purchased but the inventory decreased by 100 units then the cost of 1,100 units will be the cost of goods sold.

The second way to calculate the cost of goods sold is to use the following costs: beginning inventory + the cost of goods purchased or manufactured = cost of goods available – ending inventory.

When costs change during the accounting period, a cost flow will have to be assumed. Cost flow assumptions include FIFO, LIFO, and average.

The cost of goods sold can also be impacted by the type of costing methodology used to derive the cost of ending inventory. Consider the impact of the following two inventory costing methods:

First in, first out method. Under this method, known as FIFO, the first unit added to inventory is assumed to be the first one used. Thus, in an inflationary environment where prices are increasing, this tends to result in lower-cost goods being charged to the cost of goods sold.
Last in, first out method. Under this method, known as LIFO, the last unit added to inventory is assumed to be the first one used. Thus, in an inflationary environment where prices are increasing, this tends to result in higher-cost goods being charged to the cost of goods sold.
For example, a company has $10,000 of inventory on hand at the beginning of the month, expends $25,000 on various inventory items during the month, and has $8,000 of inventory on hand at the end of the month. What was its cost of goods sold during the month?  The answer is:

$10,000 Beginning inventory + $25,000 Purchases - $8,000 Ending inventory
= $27,000 Cost of goods sold

The cost of goods sold can be fraudulently altered by a number of means in order to change reported profit levels, such as:

Altering the bill of materials and/or labor routing records in a standard costing system
Incorrectly counting the quantity of inventory on hand
Performing an incorrect period-end cutoff
Allocating more overhead than actually exists to inventory
