Sergei Bobik of ServeTheHome , who discovered this issue, says there's a way to limit some of the write operations for the recovery.js file by tweaking one of Firefox's settings.

Adjusting this setting is easy. Users should type "about:config" in their address bar and press Enter.
Here they should search for "browser.sessionstore.interval" and double-click the option to change it.

The default is "15000" which is 15 seconds, the interval at which Firefox re-writes the contents of the recovery.js file.
One second is 1000, so if you want to set this to five minutes you should enter 300000, and if you want to use 30 minutes you should enter 1800000.
