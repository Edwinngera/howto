Design Thinking

1. Empathise - understanding of the problem - involves consulting experts - gain insight into users and their needs.
2. Define (the Problem) - asking questions which can help you look for ideas
3. Ideate -  Brainstorm, Brainwrite, get as many ideas or problem solutions as possible
4. Prototype
5. Test - Implementation and prototyping - stakeholders feedback

* * *

1. Research (why) (local and global) ( customer journey maps ) (question)
2. Ideation (what) ( collaboration) (creativity)
3. Prototyping (Fail Early)
4. Testing

* * *

Die Design Thinking-Komponenten - Werkzeugkasten

1 Verstehen - Kundenperspektive
2 Beobachten - Fokussierung
3 Sichtweise Definieren - Point-of-View
4 Ideens Finden - Ideenfindung - Kreativitätsphase
5 Prototypen Entwickeln - Prototyping - Prototyp
6 Testen - Verfeinerung - Präsentation

* * *

Eigene Werte (II): Bekannt geworden sind die klar definierten Werte der Brainstorming-Phase:
(Struktur und Aufbau des Design Thinking Process)


• Arbeite visuell (be visual)
• Nur einer spricht (one conversation at a time)
• Fördere verrückte Ideen (encourage wild ideas)
• Stelle Kritik zurück (defer judgement)
• Quantität ist wichtig (go for quantity)
• Bleib beim Thema (stay on topic)
• Baue auf den Ideen anderer auf (build on the ideas of others)

* * *

Design thinking tackles complex problem by :

1.Empathising: Understanding the human needs involved.
2.Defining: Re-framing and defining the problem in human-centric ways.
3.Ideating: Creating many ideas in ideation sessions.
4.Prototyping: Adopting a hands-on approach in prototyping. - Fail often and early!
5.Testing: Developing a prototype/solution to the problem.

Methods for design thinking include interviewing, creating user profiles, looking at other existing solutions, creating prototypes, mind mapping, asking questions like the five whys, drawing issue trees (or issue maps[26]), and situational analysis.

* * *

Common Mindsets
1. Foresight
2. Get Inspired
3. Uncertainty Works
4. Practical View
5. Head to Hands
6. Visual Impact
7. Fail to Nail

* * *

Discover, Define, Develop and Deliver
