Factors to be investigated through market research
Market research can be considered as a method of getting an idea of the needs of the customers, and some of the factors that can be investigated through this process are given as follows:

Trends in the market – Market trends or trends in the market are the movements of a market in a given period of time.
Segmentation of the market – This is the division of a market into subgroups with similar features. This is needed to create a distinction between demographics, choices, genders, and personalities, etc.
Information available – Market information is the information about prices of different products available in the market.
SWOT analysis – This analysis is an analysis of the Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats to a business or company.
Effectiveness of marketing – Marketing effectiveness takes into account risk analysis, product research, customer analysis, and competitor analysis, etc.


	Primary Market Research. Primary market research is a kind of market research which is done by the business or company itself with the objective of gathering information that can be used to improve the products, services, and functions. Primary market research is also known as field research since it is research done from scratch, without using any information that is already made available through other sources. One can gather primary data or information through qualitative research methods as well as quantitative research methods. Primary market research is the most common type of a market research method and is also the most valuable type. It is a method that only answers specific questions and not irrelevant issues.

	Secondary market research. As opposed to primary market research, secondary market research is a research technique that does not aim to gather information from scratch but relies on already available information from multiple sources. This research focuses on data or information that was collected by other people and is available for either free or paid use for others. Secondary market research takes into account many different sources for collection of information including government data, office data, newspapers, magazines, the internet, etc. One of the benefits of doing secondary market research is that it is mostly free and takes a lot less time.

	Qualitative research. Qualitative research or qualitative market research is a kind of a research method which mainly takes into account the opinions and feelings of a customer as far as a business’s products and services are concerned. This type of research tries to get behind the customer’s mind to fathom what they see lacking or whether they truly like the product or not. Some common examples of qualitative research work include doing face to face interviews, being part of focus groups, etc.

	Quantitative research. Quantitative market research is a kind of market research work that is based on hard facts and statistical data rather than the feelings and opinions of the customers or consumers. This type of research can prove useful both in terms of primary market research and secondary market research. Some of the common examples of quantitative research include exit surveys, questionnaires, on-site fieldwork and the shopping bag survey. In fact, another example of quantitative research includes researching of the previously existing financial reports, research papers. This type of research comes out with a wide range of statistics and helps to find out the size of the market as well.

Secondary market research. = Internal sources. & External sources.

	Balance sheets – Previous balance sheets of the business can be referred to in order to find stats and figures that may prove useful for evaluation.
	Profit and loss statements – Profit and loss statements can be consulted to find out what kinds of products and services resulted in profits previously.
	Inventory records – This is another piece of data which can be used as a source for secondary market research and puts into focus many stats and figures.
	Sales figures – Companies store their previous sales figures so that they can be analyzed and used for further research.

	Examples:

	Government sources – Several government sources can be used to collect a lot of useful information about multiple subjects.
	Universities and colleges – Several college students and researchers collect and file information that can be further used by businesses.
	The internet – The internet is the most used secondary market research source but has the disadvantage of several non-credible sources with incomplete information.
	Competitor data – Often, businesses use the information collected and filed by other business organizations including that gathered by their competitors.
