Factors to be investigated through market research
Market research can be considered as a method of getting an idea of the needs of the customers, and some of the factors that can be investigated through this process are given as follows:

Trends in the market – Market trends or trends in the market are the movements of a market in a given period of time.
Segmentation of the market – This is the division of a market into subgroups with similar features. This is needed to create a distinction between demographics, choices, genders, and personalities, etc.
Information available – Market information is the information about prices of different products available in the market.
SWOT analysis – This analysis is an analysis of the Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats to a business or company.
Effectiveness of marketing – Marketing effectiveness takes into account risk analysis, product research, customer analysis, and competitor analysis, etc.


	Primary Market Research. Primary market research is a kind of market research which is done by the business or company itself with the objective of gathering information that can be used to improve the products, services, and functions. Primary market research is also known as field research since it is research done from scratch, without using any information that is already made available through other sources. One can gather primary data or information through qualitative research methods as well as quantitative research methods. Primary market research is the most common type of a market research method and is also the most valuable type. It is a method that only answers specific questions and not irrelevant issues.

	Secondary market research. As opposed to primary market research, secondary market research is a research technique that does not aim to gather information from scratch but relies on already available information from multiple sources. This research focuses on data or information that was collected by other people and is available for either free or paid use for others. Secondary market research takes into account many different sources for collection of information including government data, office data, newspapers, magazines, the internet, etc. One of the benefits of doing secondary market research is that it is mostly free and takes a lot less time.

	Qualitative research. Qualitative research or qualitative market research is a kind of a research method which mainly takes into account the opinions and feelings of a customer as far as a business’s products and services are concerned. This type of research tries to get behind the customer’s mind to fathom what they see lacking or whether they truly like the product or not. Some common examples of qualitative research work include doing face to face interviews, being part of focus groups, etc.

	Quantitative research. Quantitative market research is a kind of market research work that is based on hard facts and statistical data rather than the feelings and opinions of the customers or consumers. This type of research can prove useful both in terms of primary market research and secondary market research. Some of the common examples of quantitative research include exit surveys, questionnaires, on-site fieldwork and the shopping bag survey. In fact, another example of quantitative research includes researching of the previously existing financial reports, research papers. This type of research comes out with a wide range of statistics and helps to find out the size of the market as well.

Secondary market research. = Internal sources. & External sources.

	Balance sheets – Previous balance sheets of the business can be referred to in order to find stats and figures that may prove useful for evaluation.
	Profit and loss statements – Profit and loss statements can be consulted to find out what kinds of products and services resulted in profits previously.
	Inventory records – This is another piece of data which can be used as a source for secondary market research and puts into focus many stats and figures.
	Sales figures – Companies store their previous sales figures so that they can be analyzed and used for further research.

	Examples:

	Government sources – Several government sources can be used to collect a lot of useful information about multiple subjects.
	Universities and colleges – Several college students and researchers collect and file information that can be further used by businesses.
	The internet – The internet is the most used secondary market research source but has the disadvantage of several non-credible sources with incomplete information.
	Competitor data – Often, businesses use the information collected and filed by other business organizations including that gathered by their competitors.

How to do a Value Chain Analysis:
(I like to do this type of analysis in a spreadsheet, so that I can add, delete, amend, and sort easily and see the comparative data clearly.)

include all the primary or direct activities, such as
purchases of supplies, materials, incoming shipping
manufacturing and operations (or if a consumer based business - inventory control and operations)
outgoing shipping and logistics
customer service - includes estimating, coordinating, scheduling
marketing
sales
then include all the support or indirect activities, such as
accounting and finance
systems support
legal
environmental
safety
human resources (hiring, firing, training, and more)
new product or service research and development







Starbucks -----------------------------------------------------------------

Primary activities

Inbound logistics: This refers to the agents of the company purchasing coffee beans in Africa, communicating the importance of quality standards in the coffee beans and building strategic partnerships with suppliers.
Operations: Starbucks is currently in over 50 countries, with both direct stores operated by the company and licensing deals.
Outbound logistics: The normal process is Starbucks selling their products in store without any intermediaries. Recently, there are now retail products available in select supermarket chains.
Marketing and Sales: There is no heavy investment in marketing, but specials and tastings are common, especially when new stores open.
Service: One of their main objectives is to provide superior levels of customer service.
Support activities

Infrastructure: This is all of the general activities that are required to keep the stores operational, like management, finance, legal support and government relations.
Human Resources: There are a wide range of training programs available for staff, who are considered to be one of Starbucks most important resources.
Technological development: They make use of technology to save costs, and deliver a consistent tasting coffee, anywhere in the world.
Procurement: All the purchasing that is required to produce the end products, like the coffee beans, raw food items as well as the buildings, and machinery.




Pizza Hut ----------------------------------------------------------------------

As another example, let’s look at the value chain of Pizza Hut:

Primary activities

Inbound logistics: This includes all of the sourcing activities to procure and standardize all of the produce, ingredients and materials to bake pizza’s fast, consistently, and delicious – in house. They capitalize on economies of scale, and use massive global purchase orders to source the best prices on raw products for their restaurants.
Operations: By targeting areas where there is an affinity for Italian food, Pizza Hut operates in a huge number of countries globally with a licensing model where stores are managed by a local franchise owner.
Outbound logistics: There are two models that Pizza Hut capitalizes on, in store dining and their home delivery service.
Marketing and Sales: There is a large investment in marketing to drive additional sales, and compete with the other fast food chains.
Service: The entire goal of Pizza Hut is to offer value to their customers in affordable and convenient pizza that everyone can enjoy.
Support activities

Infrastructure: Again, this includes every other activity that is required to keep the stores in business, such as finance, legal, etc.
Human Resources: To keep the costs down staff are typically junior, and unskilled.
Technological development: The process they have created to have unskilled chefs cooking the pizza is their biggest asset. Breaking down the complicated method into simple steps that can be repeated again and again for consistently great pizza.
Procurement: The purchasing and activities required to produce the pizza, the raw food, and all of the buildings, and equipment needed to cook and deliver the pizzas.




Starbucks -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Primary Activities

Inbound Logistics
The inbound logistics for Starbucks refers to selecting the finest quality of coffee beans by the company appointed coffee buyers from coffee producers in Latin America, Africa and Asia. In the case of Starbucks, the green or unroasted beans are procured directly from the farms by the Starbucks buyers. These are transported to the storage sites after which the beans are roasted and packaged. These are now ready to be sent to the distribution centers few of which are company owned and some are operated by other logistic companies. The company does not outsource its procurement to ensure high quality standards right from the point of selection of coffee beans.

Operations
Starbucks operates in 65 countries either in the form of direct stores operated by the company or as licensed stores. Starbucks has more than 21,000 stores internationally which includes Starbucks Coffee, Teavana, Seattle’s Best Coffee and Evolution Fresh retail locations. According to its annual report, the company generated 79% of the total revenue during fiscal year 2013 from its company operated stores while the licensed stores accounted for 9% of the revenue.

Outbound Logistics
There is very little or no presence of intermediaries in product selling. Majority of the products are sold in their own or licensed stores only. As a new venture, the company has launched a new range of single-origin coffees which will be sold through some leading retailers in the U.S.; these are Guatemala Laguna de Ayarza, Rwanda Rift Valley and Timor Mount Ramelau.

Marketing and Sales
Starbucks invests in superior quality products and high level of customer services than aggressive marketing. However, need based marketing activities are carried out by the company during new products launches in the form of sampling in areas around the stores.

Service
Starbucks aims at building customer loyalty through high level of customer service at its stores. The retail objective of Starbucks is, as it says in its annual report, “to be the leading retailer and brand of coffee in each of our target markets by selling the finest quality coffee and related products, and by providing each customer a unique Starbucks Experience.”

Support Activities

Infrastructure
This includes all departments like management, finance, legal, etc which are required to keep the company’s stores operational. Starbucks well designed and pleasing stores are complemented with good customer service provided by the dedicated team of employees in green aprons.

Human Resource Management
The company’s committed workforce is considered a key attribute in the company’s success and growth over the years. Starbucks employees are motivated through generous benefits and incentives. The company is known for taking care of its workforce and this is perhaps the reason for a low turnover of employees, which indicates great human resource management. There are many training programs conducted for employees in a setting of a work culture which keeps its staff motivated and efficient.

Technology Development
Starbucks is very well known for use of technology not only for coffee related processes (to ensure consistency in taste and quality along with cost savings) but to connect to its customers. Many customers use Starbucks stores as make a shift office or meeting place because of the free and unlimited wifi availability. The company in the year 2008 also launched mystarbucksidea.force.com as a platform where customers can ask questions, give suggestions and openly express opinions and share experiences. The company has implemented some of the suggestions given via this forum. Starbucks also uses Apple’s iBeacon System wherein customers can order their drink through the Starbucks phone app and get a notification when they walk in the store.

Procurement
This involves procuring the raw material for the final product. The company agents travel to Asia, Latin America and Africa for the procurement of high grade raw material to bring the finest coffee to its customers. The agents establish strategic relationship and partnership with a supplier which is built up after reconnaissance and communication about the company standards. High quality standards are maintained with direct involvement of the company right from the base level of selecting the finest raw material which is coffee beans in case of Starbucks.
